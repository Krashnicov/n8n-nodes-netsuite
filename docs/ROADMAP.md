# NetSuite Node - Current Issues & Roadmap

## Current Issues

### 1. Test Coverage
- The node currently lacks automated tests, making it difficult to ensure functionality works as expected
- Implementation of unit and integration tests would improve stability and facilitate future development

### 2. Documentation Gaps
- Limited inline documentation for complex methods
- Missing examples for common use cases
- No comprehensive guide for troubleshooting common issues

### 3. Error Handling
- Some error responses from NetSuite API could be more descriptively handled
- Opportunity to provide more actionable error messages for specific failure scenarios

### 4. Version Compatibility
- Limited to API version v1
- Future API versions need to be supported as they're released

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Code Improvements
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Implement more granular error handling with specific guidance for common NetSuite API errors
- **Code Modularization**: Refactor operation handlers into separate files for better maintainability
- **Performance Optimization**: Improve handling of large data sets and response pagination
- **Type Safety**: Enhance TypeScript types to better match NetSuite entity structures

### 2. Feature Enhancements
- **Additional Operations**: Support for more specialized NetSuite operations
- **Bulk Operations**: Optimized handling of bulk record creation and updates
- **Saved Searches**: Direct support for NetSuite saved searches
- **File Cabinet Integration**: Support for NetSuite File Cabinet operations
- **Multi-Version Support**: Add support for newer API versions as they're released
- **Enhanced SuiteQL Support**: More comprehensive query building and result processing

### 3. Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Implement unit tests for core functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Add integration tests with NetSuite sandbox environment
- **CI/CD Integration**: Setup automated testing in CI pipeline
- **Test Coverage Goals**: Aim for 80%+ code coverage

### 4. Documentation Improvements
- **Interactive Examples**: Provide workflow templates for common use cases
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Create a comprehensive troubleshooting section
- **API Reference**: Detailed documentation of all parameters and return values
- **Best Practices**: Guidelines for optimal usage patterns
- **Video Tutorials**: Create tutorial content for visual learners

### 5. Community Engagement
- **Example Workflows**: Share example workflows that showcase node capabilities
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Establish process for community contributions
- **Issue Tracking**: Better categorization and response to community reported issues
