# Documentation Style Guide

## 1. Tone & Voice
- Use clear, concise, and technical language.
- Maintain an authoritative yet approachable tone.
- Write in active voice and direct sentences.

## 2. Structure & Organization
### Headings & Subheadings
- Use clear, descriptive titles (e.g., "Project Structure," "Configuration Files").
- Organize content hierarchically with H1, H2, and H3 tags as needed.

### Bullet Lists & Numbering
- Use bullet lists for enumerations and concise points.
- Use numbered lists for step-by-step instructions.

### Sections
- Separate sections for overview, individual file/folder descriptions, configuration details, and usage instructions.

## 3. Formatting Guidelines
### Code Blocks
- Use fenced code blocks (triple backticks) for commands and code snippets.
- Ensure code is indented properly and syntax-highlighted when possible.

### Emphasis
- Use bold for key terms and file names.
- Use italics sparingly for additional emphasis.

### Consistency
- Maintain consistent naming conventions for files, folders, and commands.

## 4. Consistency & Terminology
- Always refer to directories as "folders" or "directories" consistently.
- Use standardized labels (e.g., README.md, LICENSE.md) without variation.
- Document abbreviations and acronyms the first time they appear.

## 5. Grammar & Punctuation
- Use proper grammar and punctuation.
- Keep sentences short and to the point.
- Avoid jargon unless it's industry standard and clearly defined.

## 6. Visual Aids & Examples
- Include diagrams or directory trees where relevant to illustrate structure.
- Use examples to clarify configuration settings or command usage.

## 7. Revision & Updates
- Keep the documentation up-to-date with the codebase.
- Include version numbers and change logs if the structure evolves.
