# NetSuite Endpoint Connectivity Test Results

## Test Environment
- Date: March 22, 2025
- n8n Version: 1.83.2
- n8n-nodes-netsuite Version: 0.7.5

## Test Workflow Summary
A test workflow was created to verify the NetSuite endpoint connectivity and interaction.
The workflow includes three operations:
1. Get Record - Retrieves a single customer record
2. List Records - Lists multiple customer records with pagination
3. Run SuiteQL - Executes a SuiteQL query to retrieve data

## Test Results

| Operation | HTTP Status | Response Contains Expected Data | Notes |
|-----------|------------|--------------------------------|-------|
| Get Record | 200 | Yes | Successfully retrieved customer data with all expected fields |
| List Records | 200 | Yes | Successfully retrieved list of customers with pagination links |
| Run SuiteQL | 200 | Yes | Successfully executed query and returned results |
| Get Record (Invalid ID) | 404 | N/A | Appropriate error handling observed |

## Connectivity Verification
- The NetSuite endpoint successfully connects using the configured credentials
- All API operations execute and return the expected response codes
- Response data structure matches the expected format defined in API documentation
